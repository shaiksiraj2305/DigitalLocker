# DigitalLocker using file_hanlding_in_java
The Digital Locker System is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to securely sign up
, log_in and upload personal files to a local locker directory.
# It provides a simple graphical user interface(GUI) built using Java Swing, and handles user authetication and file management using file handling in Java.
#This project aims to simulate a basic file storage system with login/signup functionalities -similar to how cloud lockers work - but stores data locally for simplicity and academic purposes.
